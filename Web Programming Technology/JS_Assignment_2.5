<!-- 5) Write a javascript function named length_of_array, which takes an arrayas
    argument and returns the number of elements in that array (as opposed to what
    is given by the length property of the array). Remember undefined can also be
    an element if it is explicitly set at some index, e.g. x[5] = undefined;.
    This undefined should be counted, but elements which are not present in the array
    (as arrays can be sparse), should not be counted. -->

    <!-- JS Assignment 3
    1 What is a sparse array illustrate its importance with example.
    2 List  different keywords in javascript
    3 Difference between == and === operators in javascript , illustrate with example
    4 With example illustrate typeof operator
    5 With a suitable example explain for loop in javascript
    6 With suitable example explain date methods in javascript -->
