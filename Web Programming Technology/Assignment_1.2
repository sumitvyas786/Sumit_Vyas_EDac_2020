Irrfan Khan's father ran a tire business and his mother was a housewife.  Irrfan Khan died on April 29, 2020, at the age of 53 years due to colon infection. 
    <br><br>
    Irrfan Khan was a skilled cricketer and was selected for CK Nayudu Tournament-- a stepping stone to First-Class cricket for under 23 players. However, he did not turn up for the tournament owing to lack of funds.

When Irrfan Khan arrived in Bombay, he worked as an air conditioner repairman and one of the houses he visited to repair an air conditioner was the house of superstar Rajesh Khanna.
